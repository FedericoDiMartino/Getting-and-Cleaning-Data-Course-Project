# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
For the coursera assignment

## To process the data I wrote code to do the following steps:
* Read the data from the text files into R using read.table()
* Gave any unnamed variables names
* Merged the data within each of the two sets ('train' and 'test') using the dplyr package
* Merged the two sets using the dplyr package
* Extracted any the measurements required for the assignment (means and standard deviation)
* Used aggregate() to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Wrote this data set to a text file
