## Description of the variables

subject: The identifying number unique to each subject
activity: The name of each type of activity
subjectid: same as subject
activityid: The identifying number unique to each activity



The other variables are named according to the following scheme

* A first letter 't' or 'f' signifying that the variable is time or frequency domain respectively
* The word 'Body' or 'Gravity signifying that the variable is an acceleration signal of the body or due to gravity respectively
* The word 'Acc' or 'Gyro' signifying that the variable is a measurement from an accelerometer or gyroscope respectively
* 'Jerk' signifies that the variable is obtained from the derivation of linear acceleration and angular velocity
* 'Mag' signifies that the variable is obtained from the magnitude of three-dimensional signals
* 'Mean' or 'mean' signifies a that the variable is a mean
* 'std' signifies a that the variable is a standard deviation
* 'X', 'Y' or 'Z' indicates which dimension the variable is along
